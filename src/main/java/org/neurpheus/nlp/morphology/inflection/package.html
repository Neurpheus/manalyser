Classes which represents and manages inflection patterns.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
The {@link org.neurpheus.nlp.morphology.inflection.InflectionPatternImpl} is a basic implementation of the 
{@link org.neurpheus.nlp.morphology.inflection.InflectionPattern} interface and represents a set of rules which can
create any form of a lexeme (word)
</p>
<p>
Each inflection pattern covers a set of lexemes which have different cores
and the same inflection rules. The cores covered by the same inflection pattern
has some similarities. The {@link org.neurpheus.nlp.morphology.inflection.CorePattern} class represents a template
for a subset of cores which have the same suffixes. A core pattern coveres
some cores belonging to single inflection patterns. The inflection patterns
could have many core patterns which covers all cores belonging to this inflection
pattern.
</p>
<p>
The {@link org.neurpheus.nlp.morphology.inflection.InflectionPatternsBase} manages all inflection patterns belonging
to a natural language. This class can create a set inflection patterns
analysing a full dictionary of any language. This class can also determine
core patterns for all inflection patterns stored in this base.
</p>
<p>
A morphological analyser process on arrays of inflection patterns. It is 
efficient to hold these arrays in a single place because the same array
can be refered by many other objects and it is good idea to represent such
array as integer identifiers. The {@link org.neurpheus.nlp.morphology.inflection.InflectionPatternsMap} class 
represents a mapping between integer identifiers and arrays of inflection
patterns.
</p>
<p>
The {@link org.neurpheus.nlp.morphology.inflection.InflectionPatternFactory} creates inflection patterns and inflection
patterns bases (IPBes). Bacause IPBes can be used in many places in the system, this 
class registers IPBes and returns an IPB for a required language in any place
of a code.
